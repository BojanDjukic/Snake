# SNAKE

Snake is a game where the player maneuvers a line which grows in length, with the line itself being a primary obstacle. 
The player controls a dot, square, or object on a bordered plane. As it moves forward, it leaves a trail behind, resembling a moving snake.
Player attempts to eat apples by running into them with the head of the snake. Each object eaten makes the snake longer, so maneuvering is progressively more difficult. Player can move the snake in 4 directions: UP, DOWN, LEFT and RIGHT.
